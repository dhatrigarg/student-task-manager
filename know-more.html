    <h1>Know More About Website</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Smart Task Planner is a web-based application designed to help students
      manage their academic and personal tasks in a smart, organized, and efficient way.
      In today’s fast-paced world, students often struggle with multiple deadlines, assignments,
      exams, and personal responsibilities. This website aims to solve that problem by providing
      an intelligent system that not only stores tasks but also guides students on what to do next.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of the Website</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this website is to improve student productivity by reducing confusion
      and decision fatigue. Many students know they have work to do, but they are unsure which task
      should be prioritized first. This platform removes that uncertainty by analyzing tasks and
      recommending the most important one based on study relevance, deadlines, and effort required.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How This Website Helps Students</h2>
    <p>
      This website acts as a personal productivity assistant for students. Users can add tasks,
      specify deadlines, effort levels, and categorize tasks as study-related or non-study-related.
      The system then evaluates all tasks and suggests which task should be completed first.
    </p>
    <p>
      By doing this, students save time, reduce stress, and focus their energy on the most impactful
      activities instead of randomly choosing tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ease of Use</h2>
    <p>
      The website is designed to be extremely simple and beginner-friendly. No technical knowledge
      is required to use it. The interface is clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, allowing
      users to quickly add, delete, or mark tasks as completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since tasks are stored using local storage, students do not need to create accounts or log in.
      Their data remains accessible on the same device without complexity.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Benefits of Using This Website</h2>
    <p>
      Some key benefits include improved time management, better focus on studies, reduced stress,
      and increased productivity. Students can clearly see what needs to be done and why a certain
      task is important at that moment.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Who Can Use This Website</h2>
    <p>
      This platform is suitable for school students, college students, and even individuals who want
      a simple task management tool. However, it is especially optimized for students who need help
      balancing academic workloads.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Smart Task Planner is more than just a task list. It is a smart assistant that
      helps students make better decisions, stay organized, and achieve their academic goals.
      By combining simplicity with intelligent logic, this website provides a practical solution
      to everyday productivity challenges faced by students.
